# Robot Octodollop

**playground** - n. a place where people can play

## About this repository
This repo serves as a playground for [RobotPy](https://robotpy.github.io/) and [PyQt v.5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) in hopes that we may actually use this code to create software for the robot and this year's FRC competition (2018).

When something is actually made with these technologies in Octodollop, they will be dumped into Resonance, the name of the robot software (though there's no repo yet).
