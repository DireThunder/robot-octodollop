# Robot Octodollop

**playground** - n. a place where people can play

## About this repository
This repo serves as a playground for [RobotPy](https://robotpy.github.io/) and [PyQt v.5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) in hopes that we may actually use this code to create software for the robot and this year's FRC competition (2018).

When something is actually made with these technologies in Octodollop, they will be dumped into [Resonance](http://www.github.com/dmsmechamonarchs2896/resonance), the name of the robot software.

This code is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE); feel free to use this code to mess around with PyQt and RobotPy. If you want something more solid, check out the [Resonance](http://www.github.com/dmsmechamonarchs2896/resonance) repository.

## Requisites
